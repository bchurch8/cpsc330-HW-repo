    "At this point we are at the end of supervised machine learning part of the course. So in this homework, you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). **Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary.** \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "4. If you are having trouble running models on your laptop because of the size of the dataset, you can create your train/test split in such a way that you have less data in the train split. If you end up doing this, please write a note to the grader in the submission explaining why you are doing it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (2-8 hours???) is a good guideline for a typical submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "\n",
    "In this mini project, you will be working on a classification problem of predicting whether a customer will cancel the reservation they have made at a hotel. \n",
    "For this problem, you will use [Reservation Cancellation Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reservation-cancellation-prediction?select=train__dataset.csv). In this data set, there are about 18.000 examples and 18 features (including the target), and the goal is to estimate whether a person will cancel their booking; this column is labeled \"booking_status\" in the data (1 = canceled). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means. You can find this information in the documentation on [the dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reservation-cancellation-prediction?select=train__dataset.csv). Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",
    "2. Download the dataset and read it as a pandas dataframe. "

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. \n",
    "Looking at the problem and dataset, my initial thoughts are that there are going to broadly be two types of cancellations: predictable and un-predictable. A predictable cancellation is one that the data in the dataset could potentially help predict. For example, if the customer is travelling alone, booked shortly before the arrival date, and is only staying a few nights it may be predictable that they cancel. This person could be travelling for business and have plans change often and as such cancel hotels fairly routinely as their travel plans change. On the other hand, if the customer is travelling with children or a large group, booked far in advance, and has made several special requests for their room they might be less likely to cancel as this is probably a vacation or larger trip that was planned well in advance, which often isn't cancelled once booked. However, the data will never be able to help \"un-predictable\" cancellations as these are caused by factors completely irrelevant to the booking itself. For example, even though a family may have booked a vacation many months in advance, they may still have to cancel last-minute because of a health emergency or something similar.  As such, it seems like there will always be a limit to how accurate our model can be because it will not be able to predict these external factors."

The average room price histogram shows that the distributions are fairly similar, but there are fewer cancellations for rooms less than $100 and slightly more cancellations above $100."

    "The majority of our features have integer data types, but some of these features are categorical or ordinal. Looking at the unique values within each feature can help us determine which category the data falls into. For example, room_type_reserved has an integer datatype but each integer represents a different room type as defined by INN Hotels so this data is actually categorical. Some of the integer features which take a small, finite set of values could also be considered ordinal. For example, no_of_adults only takes value from 0 to 4 and there is a clear ordered relation between consecutive values so we could treat this feature as ordinal instead of numeric."

    "Looking at the histograms of previous bookings cancelled versus not cancelled, we see that the vast majority of customers have not either cancelled or completed a previous reservation. Checking the repeated guests feature, we can see that only 2.5% of guests are repeat customers. Therefore it makes sense that there wouldn't be many examples where previous bookings were cancelled or not-cancelled. It could be useful to drop these features as they generally don't add much information, but they could be very useful in the few cases where they are not zero. "

    "## Initial Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "From the exploratory data analysis, it is clear that there are many potential ways to categorize and process the data. For many of the features you could argue that they should considered numerical, ordinal, or categorical. For example, number of adults could be considered as simple numerical data, ordinal data since it is discrete and there is a clear relationship between each value (difference between 2 and 1 is one person), or even categorical if you don't think the relationship between different numbers of adults matters. There is also some ambiguity with the data in its current form. The type of meal plan or room type feature could be ordinal but it's impossible to conclude that without knowing more about the hotel's systems.  The number of special requests also is hard to interpret because not all special requests are the same and reducing them all to a count loses some specificity. \n",

    "## Assessment Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the class imbalance is not extreme, accuracy will still be a good indicator of model performance. However, we think precision will be the most important metric to optimize. If the model predicts that a customer is likely to cancel their reservation, the hotel will likely try to re-book the room in preparation for a cancellation. If this prediction was a false positive and the customer does not cancel, the hotel will have a double-booked room which will be costly from both a customer satisfaction and economic standpoint. The customer won't be happy about not getting their desired room and the hotle will likely have to compensate the customer for the inconvenience."
